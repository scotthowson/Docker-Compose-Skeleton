# Exits the script gracefully while logging an error message with the exit code.
# It captures the last command's exit status and logs it before exiting.
# Usage: Should be called in a context where an error has occurred, and the script needs to exit.

    # Log the error with the exit code

    exit "${exit_code}"  # Exit with the captured exit code
